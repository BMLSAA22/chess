<h3 style="color:grey">this is one of my first projects i've ever done in 2020</h3>
This GitHub repository houses a meticulously crafted Chess implementation using only JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. With a focus on simplicity and elegance, this project provides an interactive chessboard that runs directly in your web browser.
<h2>Pure Web Technologies</h2> No external libraries or frameworks are used, making this chess implementation lightweight and easy to integrate into any web project.

<h2 style="color:green">Legal Move Validation</h2> All moves are rigorously validated, adhering to the rules of chess, including castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.
Check and Checkmate Detection: The game detects checks and checkmates, providing a challenging and engaging experience.

<H2 style="color:green">i will modify it to build a trained bot to play chess using RL on top of it. </H2>
